Deep learning in finance  
* Numerically solving PDE is difficult for high dimensional problems using conventional numerical methods e.g. finite-difference methods, finite element methods.          
* Deep learning is successful to deal with high dimensional data e.g. images, languages, speech sequences.  
* It seems deep learning is attractive in dealing with high dimensional problems even though the underlying optimization details are not fully understood.  
* This model is a deep Learning based PDE solver for stochastic PDE used in finance pricing e.g. basket options.
