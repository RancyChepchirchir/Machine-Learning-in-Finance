Deep learning in finance
Numerically solving PDE is difficult for high dimensional problem using conventional methods e.g. finite element methods.        
Deep learning is successful to deal with high dimensional data e.g. images, languages, speech sequences.  
It seems deep learning is attractive in dealing with high dimensional problems even though the underlying optimization details are not fully understood.  
This model is a deep Learning based PDE solver for stochastic PDE used in finance pricing e.g. basket options.
